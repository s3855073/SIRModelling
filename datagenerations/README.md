## graph_gen.py
This python script automates generating graphs of different sizes and average vertex degrees in Pajek. It does this by generating a `.log` file
which can be ran in Pajek by going to `Macro > Repeat Session` and then loading in the file. All the generated graphs will be saved in a `.net`
format inside the tests directory under the directory which this python script resides in.

## pajek-cmds/
Any of the commands generated by graph_gen.py will be stored as text files in this directory.

## test_pilot.py
This file originally lived in the main directory along with all the other java files. It automates all the tests using the graphs and test files which live in the `graphs/` and `inTestFiles/ ` directory.

##test_gen.py
Contains some logic to generate tests based on the graph given.

## pilot_tests_gen.py
Utilises the test_gen.py file to make and store all the `.in` test files inside of the `inTestFiles/` directory.
